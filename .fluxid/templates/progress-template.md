## Completion Rules

### Task Completion
 Mark complete when:
- Implementation finished and tested
- All acceptance criteria met
- Code merged to main branch

### Epic Completion
 Mark complete when:
- All tasks within epic are complete
- Epic validated against quality gates
- Integration tested

### Milestone Completion
 **CHECKPOINT - REQUIRES USER REVIEW**

 Mark complete when:
- All epics within milestone are complete
- Milestone validated against Critical Rule
- **Actually shipped to users** (not just code complete)
- Consumer-grade quality confirmed
- **User has reviewed and approved milestone completion**

**Important**: Milestone completion is a workflow checkpoint. When all epics are done, LLM agents must STOP and request user review before proceeding to the next milestone.

---

## Notes for LLM Agents

1. **Update this file** as you complete work
2. **Milestone checkpoint**: When all epics in a milestone are complete, STOP and notify the user for review - do NOT proceed to next milestone automatically
3. **Check milestone checkbox** only after user approval, when shipped, not when coded
4. **Add new tasks** to epics as needed (discovery is iterative)
5. **Never skip quality gates** - consumer-grade is non-negotiable
6. **Read this file first** to understand current project state
7. **Update Last Updated date** when making changes
