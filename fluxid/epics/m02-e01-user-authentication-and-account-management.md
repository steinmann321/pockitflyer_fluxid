# Epic: User Authentication & Account Management

## Overview
Implements complete user authentication system with email/password registration, JWT-based login, automatic profile creation, and auth-protected UI elements. This epic establishes the foundation for all authenticated features in the platform, enabling users to create accounts and securely access personalized functionality like flyer creation.

## Scope
- User registration endpoint with email/password validation and password hashing
- Login endpoint with JWT token generation and refresh
- JWT authentication middleware for protected endpoints
- Automatic default profile creation on registration
- Frontend registration form with validation
- Frontend login form with authentication
- Auth state management in Flutter app
- Header UI updates: "Login" button â†’ profile avatar when authenticated
- "Flyern" button visibility (auth-protected, shows only when logged in)
- Security measures: password strength validation, rate limiting, XSS protection

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can register with email and password [Test: valid/invalid emails, password requirements, duplicate emails, rate limiting]
- [ ] Registration automatically creates a default profile associated with the user [Test: profile exists after registration, correct associations]
- [ ] Users can log in with valid credentials and receive JWT token [Test: valid/invalid credentials, token format, token expiration]
- [ ] JWT tokens authenticate subsequent requests to protected endpoints [Test: with/without token, expired token, invalid token]
- [ ] Frontend displays profile avatar in header when authenticated [Test: logged in vs logged out states, avatar rendering]
- [ ] Frontend shows "Login" button when not authenticated [Test: unauthenticated state, button navigation]
- [ ] "Flyern" button only appears when user is logged in [Test: auth state changes, button visibility]
- [ ] Password security meets production standards [Test: hashing verification, strength validation, no plain text storage]
- [ ] Auth state persists across app sessions [Test: close/reopen app, token refresh, session expiration]
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents registration abuse [Test: multiple rapid registration attempts, different IPs]

## Tasks
- Backend user model and registration endpoint (m02-e01-t01)
- Backend login endpoint with JWT generation (m02-e01-t02)
- JWT authentication middleware for protected endpoints (m02-e01-t03)
- Frontend registration and login forms (m02-e01-t04)
- Frontend auth state management and header UI (m02-e01-t05)

## Dependencies
- Milestone m01 (discovery feed infrastructure)
- JWT library (backend)
- Password hashing library (bcrypt or similar)
- Flutter secure storage for token persistence

## Completion Checklist
**Before marking this epic complete:**
- [ ] All tasks are completed and tested
- [ ] All success criteria are validated
- [ ] Epic contributes to milestone deliverability
- [ ] No regressions or breaking changes introduced

## Notes
**Security Considerations:**
- Passwords must be hashed with bcrypt or similar (never stored plain text)
- JWT tokens must have reasonable expiration (e.g., 24 hours) with refresh capability
- Rate limiting on registration endpoint to prevent abuse
- Email validation to prevent invalid/malicious input
- XSS protection on all text input fields

**Frontend State Management:**
- Auth token stored securely (Flutter secure storage)
- Auth state available globally (Provider, Bloc, or similar)
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Clear token on logout or expiration

**Backend Architecture:**
- RESTful endpoints: POST /api/register, POST /api/login
- JWT middleware applied to all protected routes
- Default profile creation via signal/hook on user creation
- Proper HTTP status codes (201 Created, 401 Unauthorized, etc.)

This epic maps to milestone m02 success criteria lines 13-17, 27 and requirement sections:
- Authentication & User Profiles (refined-product-analysis.md lines 168-180)
- User Management (refined-product-analysis.md lines 78-87)
