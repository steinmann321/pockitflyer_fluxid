# Epic: Privacy Settings and Email Permissions

## Overview
Users can control their privacy preferences through a dedicated settings system. The primary privacy control is an email contact permission toggle that determines whether other users can contact them via email. Privacy settings are stored on the backend and enforced across the platform. The settings UI is accessible from the user's profile page and provides clear explanations of each privacy option.

## Scope
- Privacy settings screen accessible from user profile
- Email contact permission toggle (on/off)
- Backend privacy settings model and database storage
- API endpoints for retrieving and updating privacy settings
- Privacy settings validation and enforcement on backend
- Settings state management in frontend
- Default privacy settings for new users
- Clear UI explanations of privacy implications

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Authenticated users can access privacy settings from their profile [Test: navigation from profile, settings button visible, back navigation]
- [ ] Users can toggle email contact permission on/off [Test: toggle on, toggle off, verify state persistence, verify UI reflects state]
- [ ] Privacy settings persist across app restarts [Test: change setting, quit app, relaunch, verify setting maintained]
- [ ] Backend stores and retrieves privacy settings correctly [Test: database record creation, update, retrieval, user association]
- [ ] Default privacy settings applied to new user registrations [Test: new user registration, verify default email permission state]
- [ ] Privacy changes are reflected immediately in app [Test: toggle setting, verify API call, verify UI update, no page refresh needed]
- [ ] Backend validates privacy setting updates [Test: invalid values, unauthorized access attempts, concurrent updates]
- [ ] Settings UI clearly explains each privacy option [Test: readability, clarity of email permission description, help text]
- [ ] API enforces privacy settings (email contact permission) [Test: verify permission checked before allowing email contact in future features]
- [ ] Settings update completes within 2 seconds [Test: various network conditions, verify optimistic UI update]

## Dependencies
- Epic m02-e01 (requires authentication system)
- Epic m02-e02 (settings accessible from profile page)
- Foundation for M03 features that will respect privacy settings (email contact)

## Completion Checklist
**Before marking this epic complete:**
- [ ] All tasks are completed and tested
- [ ] All success criteria are validated
- [ ] Epic contributes to milestone deliverability
- [ ] No regressions or breaking changes introduced

## Notes
- Privacy settings are user-specific (not global)
- Email contact permission controls whether other users can send emails via the platform (feature to be implemented in M03)
- Default email permission: ON (users can be contacted by default, must opt-out)
- Privacy settings are separate from profile data (different model/table)
- Consider adding more privacy options in future milestones (e.g., profile visibility, flyer visibility)
- Settings changes should use optimistic UI updates with rollback on error
- Backend must enforce privacy settings at API level, not just UI level
- Privacy settings are NOT retroactive (e.g., changing email permission doesn't affect past communications)
- Consider GDPR/privacy law compliance (data export, deletion rights) in future milestone
- Settings screen should be simple and uncluttered - only one toggle for MVP
