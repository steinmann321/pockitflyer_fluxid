# Task: Filter Integration Testing and Validation

## Context
Part of Category and Proximity Filtering (m01-e03) in Browse and Discover Local Flyers (m01).

Comprehensive validation of the complete filtering system through integration tests covering all success criteria from the epic, edge case handling, performance validation, and user experience verification across the full stack (backend + frontend).

## Implementation Guide for LLM Agent

### Objective
Validate the entire filtering system works correctly end-to-end through comprehensive integration tests, edge case coverage, performance checks, and UX validation to ensure production readiness.

### Steps
1. Create backend integration test suite
   - File: `pockitflyer_backend/flyers/tests/test_filter_integration.py`
   - **Test scenarios** (10-12 tests):
     - Single category filter returns correct flyers
     - Multiple category filter (OR logic) returns flyers matching ANY selected category
     - All categories selected returns all flyers
     - No categories selected (empty filter) returns all flyers
     - Proximity filter with valid location returns flyers within max_distance
     - Proximity filter at boundary (flyer exactly at max_distance) included
     - Combined category + proximity returns correct subset (AND logic)
     - Invalid category returns 400 error with details
     - Proximity filter without lat/lng returns 400 error
     - Filter with zero results returns empty array (not error)
     - Filters integrate with pagination correctly
     - Filters integrate with ranking algorithm (filtered results are ranked)
   - Use Django test client for API calls
   - Set up test database with known flyer data for predictable results

2. Create frontend integration test suite
   - File: `pockitflyer_app/test/features/feed/integration/filter_full_flow_test.dart`
   - **Test scenarios** (8-10 tests):
     - Apply single category filter → feed updates with filtered flyers
     - Apply multiple categories → feed shows flyers matching ANY category
     - Toggle proximity filter on → feed shows nearby flyers only
     - Combine category + proximity → feed shows correct subset
     - Clear all filters → feed returns to full unfiltered state
     - Rapid filter toggling triggers single debounced API call
     - Filter state persists during navigation (navigate away, return, filters active)
     - No location permission → proximity filter disabled with error message
     - Zero results from filters → empty state displayed with helpful message
     - API error during filtering → error message displayed, feed remains usable
   - Use `testWidgets` with mocked HTTP client (Dio)
   - Mock API responses for predictable results

3. Edge case testing
   - **Test scenarios** (6-8 tests):
     - Flyer with multiple categories matches filter correctly (flyer tagged "events,nightlife" matches "events" filter)
     - User location changes while proximity filter active → feed updates
     - Max distance = 0 → only exact location matches (edge case)
     - Very large max_distance (e.g., 1000km) → all flyers returned
     - Special characters in search (not primary filter, but ensure compatibility)
     - Backend returns malformed data → frontend handles gracefully
     - Network timeout during filter API call → error handling
     - Concurrent filter changes (user rapidly taps multiple filters) → final state correct

4. Performance validation
   - **Test scenarios** (4-6 tests):
     - Filter 100+ flyers: response time < 500ms (backend)
     - Rapid filter toggling (10 toggles in 2 seconds) → UI remains responsive, no crashes
     - Filter change → feed update transition smooth (no flicker or jump)
     - Debouncing prevents excessive API calls (verify single call after multiple rapid changes)
     - Pagination with filters: scroll through 50+ pages smoothly
     - Memory usage stable during extended filtering session
   - Use performance profiling tools if needed (Dart DevTools for frontend, Django debug toolbar for backend)

5. User experience validation
   - **Manual testing checklist** (not automated, verify on simulator):
     - [ ] Active filter visual state is clear and distinct
     - [ ] Filter transitions are smooth (no janky animations)
     - [ ] Loading indicators appear during filter API calls
     - [ ] Empty state message is helpful and actionable
     - [ ] Error messages are user-friendly (not technical jargon)
     - [ ] Clear button is easy to find and use
     - [ ] Filter bar is accessible on all screen sizes (iPhone SE to Pro Max)
     - [ ] Accessibility: VoiceOver can navigate filter controls
     - [ ] Haptic feedback on filter taps (optional, nice-to-have)
   - Document UX validation results in test report or commit message

6. Cross-layer integration validation
   - **Test scenarios** (4-6 tests):
     - Backend filter logic matches frontend filter state (categories map correctly)
     - Distance calculation consistent between backend and frontend display
     - Filter API response format matches frontend expectations (no serialization errors)
     - Pagination metadata correct with filters (total count, next page, etc.)
     - Ranking algorithm applies after filtering (verify order of results)
     - Combined filters from epic success criteria work end-to-end

7. Regression testing
   - **Test scenarios** (3-5 tests):
     - Existing feed functionality unaffected by filters (pull-to-refresh still works)
     - Flyer card display unchanged (all elements still visible)
     - Navigation to creator profile still works from filtered feed
     - Image carousels still functional in filtered flyers
     - No new console errors or warnings introduced

8. Create test report
   - Document all test results in structured format
   - File: `fluxid/tasks/m01-e03-t04-test-report.md` (or inline in commit message)
   - Include:
     - Summary: total tests, passed, failed, skipped
     - Coverage metrics (aim for >85% on filter code)
     - Performance results (response times, UI responsiveness)
     - Edge cases validated
     - Known issues or limitations (if any)
     - UX validation checklist results
   - Attach to task completion evidence

### Files to Create/Modify
- `pockitflyer_backend/flyers/tests/test_filter_integration.py` - NEW: backend integration tests
- `pockitflyer_app/test/features/feed/integration/filter_full_flow_test.dart` - NEW: frontend integration tests
- `pockitflyer_app/test/features/feed/integration/filter_edge_cases_test.dart` - NEW: edge case tests
- `pockitflyer_app/test/features/feed/integration/filter_performance_test.dart` - NEW: performance tests
- `fluxid/tasks/m01-e03-t04-test-report.md` - NEW: test report (optional, can be in commit message)

### Testing Requirements
**Note**: E2E testing (without mocks) is handled in the dedicated E2E validation epic. Use integration tests with mocked external services here.

- **Integration tests (backend)**: Full API requests with test database, verify filter logic end-to-end, cover all query parameter combinations
- **Integration tests (frontend)**: Full widget tree with mocked HTTP client, verify filter flow from UI → provider → API → UI update
- **Edge case tests**: Boundary conditions, error scenarios, unusual input combinations
- **Performance tests**: Response times, UI responsiveness, memory usage, debouncing effectiveness

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All tests written and passing
- [ ] Code follows project conventions (backend Django, frontend Flutter)
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Test coverage >85% on filter code
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] UX validation completed
- [ ] Test report completed
- [ ] Changes committed with reference to task ID (m01-e03-t04)
- [ ] Epic m01-e03 ready for completion review

## Dependencies
- Requires: m01-e03-t01 (Backend filters implemented), m01-e03-t02 (Filter UI implemented), m01-e03-t03 (State management implemented)
- Blocks: Epic m01-e03 completion

## Technical Notes
- Use Django `APIClient` for backend integration tests (not `TestCase.client` for better DRF support)
- Use Flutter `testWidgets` with `ProviderScope` for frontend integration tests
- Mock HTTP client with `dio_http_mock` or custom mock for predictable API responses
- For performance tests, use `Stopwatch` in Dart, `time.time()` in Python
- Test database should have diverse flyer data: various categories, locations, distances
- UX validation requires running on iOS simulator (iPhone SE, iPhone 14 Pro recommended)
- Ensure all tests are marked with `@pytest.mark.tdd_green` (Python) or `tags: ['tdd_green']` (Dart) after passing
