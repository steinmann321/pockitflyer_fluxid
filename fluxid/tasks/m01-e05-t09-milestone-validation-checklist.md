# Task: Milestone M01 Validation Checklist Completion

## Objective
Systematically validate all 13 success criteria from the M01 Anonymous Discovery milestone document to ensure the complete milestone is production-ready and meets all user experience and technical requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Validation script: `scripts/validate_m01_milestone.py`
- [ ] Script validates all 13 M01 milestone success criteria:
  1. **Feed browsing without authentication**:
     - Launch app, verify feed loads without login prompt
     - Assert: flyers visible immediately
  2. **Location-based flyer feed with accurate distance calculations**:
     - Verify distance displayed on each flyer card
     - Compare to expected distance (from test data coordinates)
     - Assert: distance accurate within 100m
  3. **Flyer data completeness** (creator, title, description, images, location, dates):
     - Inspect flyer cards: all fields present
     - Assert: no missing or null data displayed
  4. **Multi-category filtering** (Events, Nightlife, Service):
     - Apply each category filter individually
     - Assert: results match category
     - Apply multiple categories
     - Assert: OR logic (Events OR Nightlife)
  5. **"Near Me" location radius filtering**:
     - Toggle "Near Me" filter (5km radius)
     - Assert: only flyers within 5km shown
     - Verify via database query
  6. **Free-text search in titles and descriptions**:
     - Enter search term
     - Assert: results contain term in title OR description
     - Verify case-insensitive matching
  7. **Combined filtering** (category + location + search):
     - Apply all three filters simultaneously
     - Assert: AND/OR logic correct
     - Verify via backend SQL log
  8. **Image carousel on flyer detail screen**:
     - Navigate to flyer with multiple images
     - Swipe carousel
     - Assert: all images load and display correctly
  9. **iOS Maps integration for flyer locations**:
     - Tap location button on flyer detail
     - Assert: iOS Maps launches with correct coordinates
     - Verify coordinates in Maps deep link URL
  10. **Creator profile viewing with flyer history**:
     - Tap creator name
     - Assert: profile loads with all creator's flyers
     - Verify flyer count matches database
  11. **Performance targets met** (<2s feed load, <500ms queries):
     - Measure feed load time (cold start)
     - Assert: <2 seconds
     - Measure filtered query time
     - Assert: <500ms
  12. **Stable operation with 100+ flyers**:
     - Test with 100+ flyers in database
     - Assert: no crashes, no performance degradation
     - Assert: pagination works smoothly
  13. **Resilient geocoding with circuit breaker**:
     - Trigger geocoding failures
     - Assert: circuit breaker activates
     - Assert: app continues functioning (graceful degradation)
- [ ] Validation report generated:
  - All 13 criteria: PASS/FAIL status
  - Detailed evidence for each (screenshots, logs, metrics)
  - Overall milestone status: READY FOR PRODUCTION / NEEDS WORK
- [ ] Manual validation checklist:
  - [ ] User experience quality: "Would I ship this to users?"
  - [ ] No obvious bugs or glitches
  - [ ] All error states handled gracefully
  - [ ] Performance acceptable on real device (not just simulator)
  - [ ] Accessibility: VoiceOver works correctly
  - [ ] Documentation: README updated, setup instructions accurate
- [ ] All validation tests marked with `@pytest.mark.tdd_green` after passing

## Test Coverage Requirements
- All 13 M01 milestone success criteria validated end-to-end
- Each criterion validated with real services (NO MOCKS)
- Validation script runs autonomously (no manual intervention required)
- Validation report machine-readable (JSON) and human-readable (Markdown)
- Validation repeatable (can run multiple times, always same result)
- Validation fast (<5 minutes total execution time)

## Files to Modify/Create
- `scripts/validate_m01_milestone.py` (main validation script)
- `scripts/validation_helpers.py` (helper functions for checks)
- `maestro/flows/m01-e05/milestone_validation_full.yaml` (comprehensive Maestro flow)
- `docs/m01_validation_report_template.md` (report template)
- `docs/m01_validation_report_YYYY-MM-DD.md` (generated report)

## Dependencies
- m01-e05-t01 through t08 (all E2E tests must pass first)
- All M01 epics complete (m01-e01, m01-e02, m01-e03, m01-e04)

## Notes
**Critical: PRODUCTION READINESS GATE**
- This task is the final gate before marking M01 complete
- All 13 criteria must pass (no exceptions)
- Validation report reviewed by technical lead
- Manual quality check: "Would you ship this?"

**Validation Script Structure**:
```python
def validate_m01_milestone():
    results = []

    # Criterion 1: Feed browsing without authentication
    results.append(validate_anonymous_browsing())

    # Criterion 2: Location-based feed with accurate distances
    results.append(validate_distance_calculations())

    # ... (all 13 criteria)

    # Generate report
    generate_report(results)

    # Return overall status
    return all(r['status'] == 'PASS' for r in results)
```

**Validation Report Format**:
```markdown
# M01 Anonymous Discovery Milestone Validation Report

**Date**: 2025-01-15
**Validator**: Automated Script v1.0
**Overall Status**: ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION

## Success Criteria Validation

### 1. Feed browsing without authentication
**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Evidence**:
- Feed loaded in 1.8 seconds without login prompt
- 100+ flyers visible
- Screenshot: `evidence/feed_anonymous.png`

### 2. Location-based flyer feed with accurate distance calculations
**Status**: ✅ PASS
**Evidence**:
- 10 flyers sampled for distance accuracy
- Average error: 42 meters (well within 100m tolerance)
- Max error: 87 meters
- Screenshot: `evidence/distance_accuracy.png`

... (all 13 criteria)

## Performance Metrics
- Feed load (cold start): 1.8s (target: <2s) ✅
- Filtered query: 420ms (target: <500ms) ✅
- Memory footprint: 78MB (target: <100MB) ✅

## Manual Quality Check
- [ ] Would you ship this to users? **YES**
- [ ] Any critical bugs? **NO**
- [ ] Acceptable on real device? **YES** (tested on iPhone 14)

## Recommendation
**APPROVE MILESTONE M01 FOR PRODUCTION**
```

**Manual Validation Checklist**:
Beyond automated tests, perform manual validation:
1. Install app on real iOS device (not simulator)
2. Use app as end-user would (not QA mindset)
3. Ask: "Is this production quality?"
4. Check: Any annoying UX issues? Any visual glitches?
5. Test: All workflows feel smooth and intuitive?
6. Verify: All error messages user-friendly?
7. Confirm: Performance acceptable on older device (iPhone 11 or older)?

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All 13 automated criteria: PASS
- Manual quality check: APPROVE
- Technical lead review: APPROVE
- Documentation complete (README, setup guide, architecture diagrams)

**Evidence Collection**:
- Screenshots of each criterion validation
- Performance metrics logged (JSON format)
- Backend SQL logs showing query performance
- Maestro test results (HTML report)
- Video recording of full user flow (optional, but recommended)

**Failure Handling**:
- If ANY criterion fails: milestone NOT ready
- Document failure reason in report
- Create tasks to fix failing criteria
- Re-run validation after fixes
- Iterate until all criteria pass

**Version Control**:
- Validation report committed to git
- Tagged as `m01-validation-YYYY-MM-DD`
- Milestone completion commit references validation report
- Traceability: which code version was validated

**Next Steps After Validation**:
1. All criteria pass → Mark M01 epic complete
2. Update milestone status to "Complete"
3. Generate milestone completion announcement
4. Plan M02 kickoff
5. Archive M01 validation evidence for future reference
