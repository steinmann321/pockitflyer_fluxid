# Task: Authentication Performance and Polish

## Objective
Optimize authentication flows for performance, add polish to UI interactions, ensure production-ready quality for registration and login experiences.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Registration API response time < 1 second on local network
- [ ] Login API response time < 500ms on local network
- [ ] Token storage/retrieval < 100ms
- [ ] Smooth animations for auth state transitions (header login â†’ avatar)
- [ ] Form validation provides instant feedback (onChanged validation)
- [ ] Loading indicators follow Material Design guidelines
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] Keyboard dismisses appropriately on submit
- [ ] Tab order and form navigation works smoothly
- [ ] All tests marked with `tags: ['tdd_green']` or `@pytest.mark.tdd_green` after passing

## Test Coverage Requirements
- Performance benchmarks: API response times, token operations
- UI interaction tests: animations, loading states, error displays
- Accessibility tests: screen reader support, keyboard navigation
- Edge cases: slow network, network interruption, rapid submit clicks

## Files to Modify/Create
- `pockitflyer_backend/users/tests/test_performance.py` (API performance benchmarks)
- `pockitflyer_app/test/screens/auth/performance_test.dart` (UI performance)
- Various files for polish improvements

## Dependencies
- All previous M02-E01 tasks (this is final polish)

## Notes
- Performance targets are guidelines - adjust based on real-world testing
- Polish includes: smooth animations, haptic feedback, appropriate sounds (optional)
- Consider adding "Remember me" option for future milestone (out of scope for M02-E01)
- User-friendly errors: "Network error - please check connection" not "HTTP 500"
- Keyboard dismissal: tap outside fields or submit button
- Test on physical iOS device for realistic performance metrics
- This task focuses on refinement, not new features
