# Task: Profile System Performance Optimization

## Objective
Optimize profile viewing and editing performance to meet 5-second upload target and smooth UI experience. Focus on image caching, API response times, and UI responsiveness.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Profile picture upload completes within 5 seconds for 2MB image
- [ ] Profile screen loads within 2 seconds (typical profile with 10 flyers)
- [ ] Image caching prevents redundant avatar downloads in feed
- [ ] Backend profile API response time < 500ms
- [ ] Database queries optimized (no N+1 queries)
- [ ] Image compression reduces upload size by 50%+ without visible quality loss
- [ ] Feed scrolling remains smooth with profile pictures loaded
- [ ] All tests marked with `@pytest.mark.tdd_green` after passing

## Test Coverage Requirements
- Profile picture upload time measured: verify < 5 seconds for 2MB
- Profile picture upload time measured: verify < 3 seconds for 500KB
- Profile screen load time measured: verify < 2 seconds
- Image caching: verify same avatar not downloaded twice
- Backend API response time measured: verify < 500ms
- Database query count verified: no N+1 queries in feed
- Image compression ratio measured: verify 50%+ reduction
- Feed scroll performance: 60fps with 20+ flyers

## Files to Modify/Create
- `pockitflyer_backend/users/tests/test_profile_performance.py`
- `pockitflyer_app/test/performance/profile_performance_test.dart`
- `pockitflyer_app/lib/services/image_cache_service.dart`
- `pockitflyer_backend/users/services/image_storage.py` (optimize)

## Dependencies
- m02-e02-t04 (Profile picture upload API)
- m02-e02-t05 (Profile screen)
- m02-e02-t09 (Flyer card profile pictures)

## Notes
- Use Flutter image caching: cached_network_image package
- Backend: implement database indexing on profile.user_id
- Backend: use select_related/prefetch_related for profile queries
- Image compression: use Pillow optimize=True and quality=85
- Consider CDN for profile picture serving (future enhancement)
- Benchmark baseline performance before optimizations
- Target: smooth 60fps scroll in feed with 20+ flyers
