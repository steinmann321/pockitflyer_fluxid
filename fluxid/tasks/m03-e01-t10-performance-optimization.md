# Task: Performance Optimization and Polish

## Objective
Optimize favorite feature performance with database query optimization, efficient state updates, smooth animations, and error handling polish. Validate performance with benchmarks and real-world testing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Backend queries use database indexes efficiently (verify with EXPLAIN)
- [ ] Frontend state updates minimize widget rebuilds (use Provider selectors)
- [ ] Button animations are smooth 60fps (verify with Flutter DevTools)
- [ ] Network calls implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Error states show user-friendly messages (not raw API errors)
- [ ] Loading states provide subtle feedback (no blocking spinners)
- [ ] Local storage operations are async and non-blocking
- [ ] All tests marked with `@pytest.mark.tdd_green` or `tags: ['tdd_green']` after passing

## Test Coverage Requirements
- Backend: is_favorited query uses composite index (verify with assertNumQueries)
- Backend: favorite creation handles duplicate gracefully (no IntegrityError)
- Frontend: tapping button doesn't rebuild entire card widget
- Frontend: rapid taps handled gracefully (debouncing or queueing)
- Frontend: network timeout shows error message and rolls back state
- Frontend: button animation completes in <200ms
- Performance: feed with 100 flyers loads is_favorited field efficiently
- Performance: toggling favorite completes in <100ms (optimistic update)

## Files to Modify/Create
- `pockitflyer_backend/flyers/tests/test_performance.py` (add performance tests)
- `pockitflyer_app/test/state/favorite_state_performance_test.dart` (add performance tests)
- `pockitflyer_app/lib/widgets/favorite_button.dart` (polish animations)
- `pockitflyer_app/lib/state/favorite_state.dart` (add retry logic, error handling)

## Dependencies
- m03-e01-t01 through m03-e01-t07 (all core functionality complete)

## Notes
- Use django-debug-toolbar or assertNumQueries to verify query efficiency
- Use Flutter DevTools Timeline to measure animation performance
- Consider caching favorite status in memory to avoid repeated localStorage reads
- Error messages should be user-friendly: "Failed to favorite flyer. Please try again."
- Retry logic: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Consider analytics: track favorite success/failure rates
