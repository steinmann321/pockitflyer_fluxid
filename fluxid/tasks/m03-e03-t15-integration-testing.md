# Task: Integration Testing - Feed Filters End-to-End

## Objective
Create comprehensive integration tests validating complete feed filter functionality from backend API through frontend UI, including state management, API client, and component integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Integration test: favorites filter from button tap through API call to feed update
- [ ] Integration test: following filter from button tap through API call to feed update
- [ ] Integration test: filter state persistence and restoration
- [ ] Integration test: authentication state change triggers filter reset
- [ ] Integration test: pull-to-refresh updates filtered feeds
- [ ] Integration test: pagination works with filtered feeds
- [ ] Integration test: empty state UI appears when filters return no results
- [ ] All tests marked with `@pytest.mark.tdd_green` or `tags: ['tdd_green']` after passing

## Test Coverage Requirements
- Full stack test: filter selection → API request → response → UI update
- Backend + frontend integration (may use real backend or mock server)
- State management coordination between auth and filter states
- API client integration with filter endpoints
- Feed screen integration with filter bar widget
- Error handling across full stack (network failure, 401, etc.)
- Performance validation: filter change completes within 2 seconds
- Regression tests: existing functionality (non-filtered feed) still works

## Files to Modify/Create
- `pockitflyer_backend/flyers/tests/test_feed_filter_integration.py` (backend integration tests)
- `pockitflyer_app/integration_test/feed_filter_integration_test.dart` (frontend integration tests)

## Dependencies
- All previous tasks in M03-E03 (backend + frontend implementation complete)

## Notes
- Backend integration tests: test API endpoints with real database
- Frontend integration tests: use Flutter integration test framework
- Consider using test fixtures for consistent test data
- Integration tests slower than unit tests - focus on critical paths
- May overlap with E2E tests - differentiate by using mock data vs real full stack
- Run integration tests in CI/CD pipeline before e2e tests
